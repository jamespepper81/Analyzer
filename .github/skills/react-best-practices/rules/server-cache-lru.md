## Cross-Request LRU Caching

`React.cache()` only works within one request. For data shared across sequential requests (user clicks button A then button B), use an LRU cache.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
import { LRUCache } from 'lru-cache'

const cache = new LRUCache<string, any>({
  max: 1000,
  ttl: 5 * 60 * 1000  // 5 minutes
})

export async function getUser(id: string) {
  const cached = cache.get(id)
  if (cached) return cached

  const user = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { id } })
  cache.set(id, user)
  return user
}

// Request 1: DB query, result cached
// Request 2: cache hit, no DB query
```

Use when sequential user actions hit multiple endpoints needing the same data within seconds.

**Important considerations for serverless environments:**

- In-memory LRU caches work well when the server instance persists between requests
- For Firebase App Hosting or other serverless environments where instances may be recycled, consider:
  - Using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for shared caching
  - Using Redis (e.g., Upstash) for distributed cross-process caching
  - Accepting that cold starts will miss the cache

**When in-memory LRU is effective:**

- High-traffic applications where instances stay warm
- Data that's expensive to compute but acceptable if occasionally re-fetched
- Short TTLs (seconds to minutes) where cache misses are tolerable
